      <h1>Kitchen Chemistry</h1>
      <p>In Kitchen Chemistry we got to experiment with chemicals found in the kitchen. We got to change recipes for something to improve it.</p>
      <p>Our first mini-project was on making a sherbet recipe better. My group did so by reducing the amount of baking soda and increasing the amount of citric acid. This had the result of a reduced "toothpaste" taste and a more sour taste.</p>
      <p>The second was on improving a bouncing slime recipe to make it be more bouncy. We found this more difficult to get right because we did not know how each ingredient would affect the result.</p>
      <p>The last one included us building a launcher to launch an egg using the c02 produced by mixing acetic acid(vinegar) and sodium bicarbonate(baking soda) to launch the egg.</p>
