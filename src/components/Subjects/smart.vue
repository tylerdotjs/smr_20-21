    <h1>SMART Goals</h1>
    <p>
      SMART Goal #1: Become more proficient in programming.
      <br />This is <b>significant</b> because I need to become more programing for when it is my job.
      <br />This is <b>measurable</b> because it can be measured in the speed that it takes for me to complete a task.
      <br />This is <b>attainable</b> because it is just an improvement on my current skills.
      <br />This is <b>relevant</b> because programming is cool and is a good career path.
      <br />This is <b>trackable</b> because of my Github account.
      <br />
      <br />SMART Goal #2: Finish a math course for each semester
      <br />This is <b>specific</b> because who else wants to finish a math course each quarter
      <br />This is <b>measurable</b> because Aleks has a counter to see how far you are in the course
      <br />This is <b>achievable</b> because I have done this before
      <br />This is <b>realistic</b> because I have finished a course each semester last year
      <br />This is <b>time-bound</b> because I want to get two courses of math done before the end of this year
      <br />
      <br />SMART Goal #3 Work on smaller projects
      <br />Significant: I want to work on smaller scoped projects so that I can add more detail.
      <br />Measurable: This is done by the scope of the project
      <br />Achievable: Others are able to do it.
      <br />Realistic: I will be doing the same amount of work just more focused on one subject
      <br />Trackable: The project would be tracked by the amount of different relating subjects.
      <br />
